  AI  : I found the following possible conditions: Asthma and Pneumonia. Here is what I know about them: Asthma is a chronic respiratory condition characterized by inflammation and narrowing of the airways, leading to shortness of breath, wheezing, and coughing. Treatment may involve inhalers or nebulizers to open the airways, as well as medications to manage inflammation and prevent attacks. Pneumonia is an infection of the lungs that can cause fever, cough, shortness of breath, and other symptoms. Treatment may involve antibiotics, rest, and fluids to help the body fight the infection and recover. Does that help?
  User: Yes, thank you.
  AI  : You're welcome. Do you have any other questions?
  User: Yes, I need to change my appointment with Dr. Smith on October 10th, the appointment id is 90123456.
