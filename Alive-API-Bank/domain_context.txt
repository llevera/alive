You are an advanced AI assistant tasked with accurately selecting and invoking the correct software tool (function) based on user requests or operational context. To assist you in this critical task, you have been provided with:

A set of available Tool Definitions (JSON format, detailing function names, descriptions, and parameters).
A comprehensive Domain-Driven Design (DDD) Model Guide. This Guide is your primary and authoritative resource for decision-making.
Your absolute critical objective is to use the DDD Model Guide to select the precise function name **or sequence of function calls** from the provided Tool Definitions with 100% accuracy, ensuring robust and contextually sound execution. The Guide is structured to make this selection explicit and unambiguous, **often implying sequences through descriptions of Aggregates, Entity behaviors, and Key Operations.**

Follow these steps meticulously for every tool-calling decision:

1.  Analyze Intent and Context:
    Thoroughly examine the user's query or the operational context to deeply understand the underlying need, the subject matter, and any nuances.
    **Crucially, determine if the user's goal aligns with a simple, atomic tool invocation or if it suggests a more complex operation or multi-step pattern detailed within the DDD Model Guide (e.g., operations involving pre-checks, state validation, or sequential updates described in Aggregate behaviors or 'Key Operations / Multi-Step Interaction Patterns').**

2.  Consult the DDD Model Guide for Decision-Making:
    Identify the Correct Bounded Context: Based on your intent analysis, first determine which Bounded Context described in the Guide is most relevant to the request.
    **Holistic DDD Interpretation:** Navigate to the relevant sections, including "Tool Call Selection Logic," but also **pay close attention to descriptions of Entities, Aggregates (especially their invariants and key operations/behaviors), Value Objects, and any explicitly mentioned 'Key Operations / Multi-Step Interaction Patterns'.** These broader elements often provide critical context about necessary preconditions, post-conditions, or sequences of operations that individual tool descriptions might not fully encapsulate.
    Apply Decision Criteria Rigorously: For each tool function potentially involved, carefully evaluate the user's intent and input against its specified "Decision Criteria / Trigger Conditions," **interpreting these within the larger context of any identified multi-step patterns or Aggregate behaviors.**

    **NEW SECTION: Planning for Complex Operations and Pre-computation**
    **Proactive Information Gathering and Sequencing:**
    * Based on your comprehensive DDD interpretation, if the user's goal implies an operation with known prerequisites, dependencies, or beneficial pre-checks (e.g., checking resource availability, validating entity existence or state *before* an update/creation, fetching current values like today's date for relative calculations):
        1.  **Identify Necessary Pre-computation/Pre-checks:** Determine if the DDD suggests that certain information or state verification is crucial for the intended operation's success, to maintain invariants, or to provide the user with the most relevant outcome.
        2.  **Utilize Preparatory Tool Calls:** If available tools can provide this prerequisite information or perform these checks (e.g., query tools, validation tools, utility functions like `GetToday`), plan to invoke these tools *before* the primary operational tool call.
        3.  **Informed and Interactive Execution:**
            * Use the results of these preparatory calls to accurately parameterize subsequent calls.
            * **If a preparatory step reveals critical information that directly impacts the feasibility or outcome of the user's request (e.g., an unavailable resource, an unmet crucial precondition detailed in the DDD, a direct conflict with user parameters), you MUST inform the user of this new context. Present the findings and ask for clarification or confirmation on how to proceed before executing the primary, state-altering operation. Do not make unilateral decisions that deviate significantly from the user's original request without their explicit consent.**

3.  Select the Precise Tool Function or Sequence:
    Based on the explicit logic, differentiation, and your analysis of any **implied or explicit multi-step patterns or preparatory needs** from the DDD, determine the single, exact function name or the appropriate sequence of function calls to achieve the user's objective robustly.

4.  Formulate Parameters Accurately:
    For each function call in your plan, refer to its definition in the provided Tool Definitions for the parameter schema.
    Use the "Key Input Parameter Focus" description within the Guide's "Tool Call Selection Logic" for the chosen function(s) to understand what aspects of the user's query (or outputs from prior tool calls) should be mapped to the required parameters.

Adherence to the DDD Model Guide, especially through a **comprehensive interpretation that includes its 'Tool Call Selection Logic,' Entity and Aggregate behaviors, and 'Key Operations / Multi-Step Interaction Patterns,'** is paramount for accurate and effective tool invocation. Your goal is to translate the user's need into the precisely correct and contextually sound tool call(s) as dictated by this Guide.

BOUNDED CONTEXT: User Authentication Management
Description: This Bounded Context is responsible for managing user identity and session validity. It handles the processes of authenticating users and verifying their session tokens. This context is foundational, as a valid user token is a prerequisite for most operations in other contexts. It covers the tool functions GetUserToken and CheckToken. Selection within this context is straightforward: GetUserToken is for initial authentication based on credentials, while CheckToken is for validating an existing token.

Entities:
User
Description: Represents an individual who can interact with the system. A user is primarily identified by a username and can obtain a session token upon successful authentication. This entity's state (authenticated or not) is managed via tokens.
Properties:
username: string — The unique identifier for the user, used for login.
password: string — The secret credential for the user, used for login. (This is transient and used only for GetUserToken).
token: string — An opaque string representing an authenticated user session. This token is generated by GetUserToken and validated by CheckToken. Most other API calls require this token.
Behaviours / API Call Signatures (Inferred):
Corresponds to Tool Function Name: GetUserToken
authenticate(username: string, password: string): token_string — Authenticates the user and provides a session token.
Preconditions: User must provide a valid username and password combination recognized by the system.
Internal Data Resolution/Enrichment Steps (Examples):
- System verifies username and password against a user credential store.
- Upon successful verification, a unique session token is generated and associated with the user.
Corresponds to Tool Function Name: CheckToken
validateToken(token: string): boolean — Checks if the provided session token is currently valid.
Preconditions: A token string must be provided.
Internal Data Resolution/Enrichment Steps (Examples):
- System checks the token against a store of active session tokens, potentially verifying its expiry and integrity.
Relationships:
None explicitly defined with other entities in this model, but User's token is a prerequisite for interacting with Meeting and Reminder entities in the Scheduling Context.
Belongs to Aggregate: N/A (User can be considered an Aggregate Root if it had more complex internal state, but here it's simple)

Value Objects:
UserCredentials
Description: Represents the username and password combination used for authentication.
Properties:
username: string — The user's username.

TokenValidationChecked
  Triggered by: Call to `CheckToken`.
  Payload:
    token: string — The token that was checked.
    isValid: boolean — The result of the validation.
  Outcome / Impact: Confirms if a session is still active.
  Potential Follow-up Actions / API Calls / Data Lookups:
    - If invalid, the user might be prompted to re-authenticate using `GetUserToken`.
Tool Call Selection Logic for Bounded Context: User Authentication Management
Description: This context groups functions related to user login and session validation. If the intent is to log in or verify a session, tools from this context are chosen.

Function: `GetUserToken`
  Primary Purpose: To authenticate a user based on their username and password and obtain a session token.
  Decision Criteria / Trigger Conditions:
    - User expresses intent to log in, sign in, or start a session.
    - The system requires user credentials (username and password) to proceed.
    - No valid token is currently available, or a new token is explicitly requested.
  Key Input Parameter Focus:
    - `username`: Extract the user's provided username.
    - `password`: Extract the user's provided password.
  DDD Element Cross-Reference: Entity: User, Behaviour: authenticate

Function: `CheckToken`
  Primary Purpose: To validate if an existing user token is currently active and valid.
  Decision Criteria / Trigger Conditions:
    - User or system needs to verify the validity of an existing session token.
    - Before performing a sensitive operation, to ensure the token hasn't expired or been revoked.
    - An operation failed due to an "invalid token" error, and a re-check is desired.
  Key Input Parameter Focus:
    - `token`: Extract the existing session token that needs validation.
  DDD Element Cross-Reference: Entity: User, Behaviour: validateToken
BOUNDED CONTEXT: Scheduling Management
Description: This Bounded Context handles the creation, querying, and deletion of time-based events such as meetings and reminders. It ensures that users can manage their schedules effectively. Tool functions covered: AddReminder, QueryReminder, DeleteReminder, AddMeeting, QueryMeeting, DeleteMeeting, QueryMeetings. The selection logic differentiates based on the type of event (Reminder vs. Meeting) and the action (Add, Query, Delete), with specific query variations for meetings. A valid token from the User Authentication Management context is a prerequisite for all operations here.

Entities:
Reminder
Description: Represents a scheduled reminder for a user. It is defined by its content and a specific time. Reminders are user-specific, implied by the token. The choice between AddReminder, QueryReminder, and DeleteReminder depends on the user's intent to create, find, or remove a reminder, respectively.
Properties:

      - All identifying parameters (`meeting_topic`, `start_time`, `end_time`, `location`, `attendees`) must be provided to pinpoint the unique meeting to be deleted.
    Internal Data Resolution/Enrichment Steps (Examples):
      - System locates and removes the meeting that exactly matches all specified criteria.

    `Corresponds to Tool Function Name:` QueryMeetings
    findMeetingsByAttendee(token: string, attendee: string): list_of_meeting_info — Retrieves a list of meetings for a specified attendee.
    Preconditions:
      - Valid `token` must be provided.
      - `attendee` name must be provided.
    Internal Data Resolution/Enrichment Steps (Examples):
      - System searches for all meetings where the provided `attendee` is listed in the `attendees` array.

Invariants:
- start_time must be earlier than end_time.
- A meeting must have at least one attendee (implied, though not explicitly enforced by schema alone).
- meeting_topic cannot be empty.
Key Operations / Multi-Step Interaction Patterns:
- Corresponds to Tool Function Name: AddMeeting (primary action), potentially preceded by QueryMeetings.
Meeting Scheduling with Conflict Checking (Inferred advanced pattern):
1. User provides desired meeting details (topic, proposed start/end time, location, list of attendees).
2. Internal Pre-check (crucial for success, involves other tools): For each attendee in the attendees list:
a. Call QueryMeetings with the attendee's name.
b. Review the returned list of meetings for any overlaps with the proposed start_time and end_time.
3. Decision Point:
a. IF conflicts exist for any critical attendee, inform the user and do NOT proceed to AddMeeting, or suggest alternative times.
b. IF no critical conflicts are found (or conflicts are acceptable), THEN call AddMeeting with the gathered token, meeting_topic, start_time, end_time, location, and attendees.
4. System stores the new meeting if all parameters are valid and the AddMeeting tool function succeeds.

BOUNDED CONTEXT: Utility Services
Description: This Bounded Context provides general utility functions that are not directly tied to core domain entities like users, meetings, or reminders but offer supportive information, such as the current date. It covers the GetToday tool function.

Entities:
N/A (No specific entities are managed by the tools in this context)

Value Objects:
N/A

Aggregates:
N/A

Domain Events:
CurrentDateRetrieved
Triggered by: Call to GetToday.
Payload:
current_date: string — The current date in YYYY-MM-DD format (inferred format, API description only says "current date").
Outcome / Impact: Provides the system or user with the current date.
Potential Follow-up Actions / API Calls / Data Lookups:
- The date might be used as a default or reference when scheduling reminders or meetings (e.g., if a user says "remind me tomorrow").

Tool Call Selection Logic for Bounded Context: Utility Services
Description: Provides access to simple utility functions.

Function: `GetToday`
  Primary Purpose: To retrieve the current date.
  Decision Criteria / Trigger Conditions:
    - User intent is to know the **current date**, **today's date**.
    - Keywords: "what is today's date?", "get current date", "what day is it?".
    - No input parameters are required beyond system context (like timezone, if applicable, though not specified in API).
  Key Input Parameter Focus:
    - None required by the function definition.
  DDD Element Cross-Reference: N/A
Notes:

Assumed "content of the conference" and "time for conference" in AddReminder and DeleteReminder parameter descriptions are typos and should refer to "reminder" content and time, consistent with QueryReminder and the function names. If this assumption is incorrect, the model for Reminder entity and its associated tool call logic for these parameters would need to reflect "conference" literally.
The token parameter is ubiquitous and acts as an authentication and user association mechanism. It's produced by GetUserToken.
The QueryMeeting tool requires all parameters of a meeting to find it, implying it's for looking up a very specific, fully known meeting instance. This is distinct from QueryMeetings which is broader and attendee-focused.
For AddMeeting, sophisticated conflict resolution (checking attendee availability by calling QueryMeetings for each attendee) is an inferred multi-step process that an LLM would need to orchestrate, as it's not a single API call. The DDD model highlights this as a "Key Operation / Multi-Step Interaction Pattern" for the MeetingAggregate.
The exact format of dates returned by GetToday or expected by time parameters (beyond "%Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%S" for meetings/reminders) is not fully specified but assumed to be consistent.
The provided tool definitions are API-centric. The DDD model attempts to infer the underlying domain concepts and rules to guide an LLM in using these APIs effectively and accurately.
The distinction between QueryMeeting (finding one specific meeting using all its details) and QueryMeetings (finding all meetings for a given attendee) is critical for correct tool selection.

Domain Model
BOUNDED CONTEXT: Medical Symptom Inquiry
Description: This Bounded Context is responsible for handling user queries related to medical symptoms. It distinguishes between requests for urgent, emergency-level information and requests for general, non-emergency information about symptoms. Its primary role is to guide the selection between the EmergencyKnowledge and SymptomSearch tool functions, based on the inferred urgency and nature of the user's request concerning a specific symptom. This context ensures that medical symptom queries are routed to the appropriate specialized knowledge retrieval tool.

Entities:
MedicalKnowledgeEntry
Description: Represents a unit of medical information that can be retrieved in response to a symptom query. For the purpose of tool selection, each entry is implicitly categorized by its relevance to emergency situations versus general understanding. EmergencyKnowledge tool is used to access entries critical for emergencies, while SymptomSearch is for general informational entries related to a symptom.
Properties:
entry_id: string — Inferred unique identifier for a piece of medical knowledge.
title: string — Inferred title of the knowledge entry.
content_data: string — Inferred informational content.
associated_symptom: string — The primary symptom this entry addresses. This is used to match the 'symptom' parameter from the tool call.
urgency_level: enum ['emergency_critical', 'general_informational'] — An inferred classification that is paramount for tool selection. EmergencyKnowledge retrieves 'emergency_critical' entries, while SymptomSearch retrieves 'general_informational' entries.
Behaviours / API Call Signatures (Inferred):
Corresponds to Tool Function Name: EmergencyKnowledge
fetchEmergencyKnowledge(symptom: Symptom): MedicalKnowledgeEntry[] — Retrieves highly critical, actionable information relevant to an emergency medical situation for the given symptom. This implies filtering for MedicalKnowledgeEntry instances where urgency_level is 'emergency_critical'.
Preconditions: A symptom (Value Object) indicating a potential emergency must be provided.
Postconditions: Returns a list of emergency-specific knowledge entries.
Internal Data Resolution/Enrichment Steps (Examples):
- "The system internally queries a specialized knowledge base, filtering for entries explicitly marked for emergency use related to the normalized symptom term."
Corresponds to Tool Function Name: SymptomSearch
fetchGeneralSymptomInfo(symptom: Symptom): MedicalKnowledgeEntry[] — Retrieves general, non-emergency information about a given symptom. This implies filtering for MedicalKnowledgeEntry instances where urgency_level is 'general_informational'.
Preconditions: A symptom (Value Object) must be provided.
Postconditions: Returns a list of general informational entries about the symptom.
Internal Data Resolution/Enrichment Steps (Examples):
- "The system internally queries a comprehensive medical knowledge base for general information, potentially prioritizing educational content over acute care advice for the normalized symptom term."
Relationships:
None explicitly defined by the tools, but conceptually, many MedicalKnowledgeEntry items would exist for various symptoms.
Belongs to Aggregate: MedicalKnowledgeCorpus

Value Objects:
Symptom
Description: Represents the medical symptom provided by the user. This Value Object is the primary input for both EmergencyKnowledge and SymptomSearch. The interpretation of user intent surrounding this symptom (i.e., urgent crisis vs. general query) dictates which of the two tools is selected.
Properties:
text: string — The textual description of the symptom (e.g., "severe chest pain", "mild rash", "persistent cough").
Used by: EmergencyKnowledge (parameter symptom), SymptomSearch (parameter symptom).

Aggregates:
MedicalKnowledgeCorpus
Root: MedicalKnowledgeCorpus (conceptual root, representing the entirety of the medical knowledge base)
Includes: MedicalKnowledgeEntry (Entities)
Invariants:
- (Not directly enforced by these query-only tools, but conceptually: The knowledge base should contain clearly distinguishable emergency and general information.)
Key Operations / Multi-Step Interaction Patterns:
Corresponds to Tool Function Name: EmergencyKnowledge
- Operation: User query indicates an urgent need for information about a Symptom.
- Internal Logic: LLM synthesizes Symptom from query, infers high urgency.
- Tool Call: EmergencyKnowledge is called with the Symptom.
Corresponds to Tool Function Name: SymptomSearch
- Operation: User query indicates a general interest or non-urgent need for information about a Symptom.
- Internal Logic: LLM synthesizes Symptom from query, infers non-urgent/informational intent.
- Tool Call: SymptomSearch is called with the Symptom.

Domain Events:
EmergencySymptomQueryInitiated
Triggered by: User query interpreted as requiring immediate/emergency information for a specific symptom.
Payload:
symptom_text: string — The symptom as provided by the user.

GeneralSymptomQueryInitiated
Triggered by: User query interpreted as requiring general information for a specific symptom, without emergency indicators.
Payload:
symptom_text: string — The symptom as provided by the user.
timestamp: datetime — Time of query.
Outcome / Impact: Leads to the selection and execution of the SymptomSearch tool.
Potential Follow-up Actions / API Calls / Data Lookups:
- Call SymptomSearch(symptom=symptom_text).

Tool Call Selection Logic for Bounded Context: Medical Symptom Inquiry
Description: This Bounded Context focuses on user queries about medical symptoms. Selection logic within this context critically differentiates between the need for emergency information versus general information concerning a symptom. The user's language, the nature of the symptom itself, and explicit requests for types of information are key differentiators.
Function: EmergencyKnowledge
Primary Purpose: To retrieve critical, actionable information for a medical symptom that indicates a potential emergency.
Decision Criteria / Trigger Conditions:
- User's query contains explicit keywords indicating urgency or crisis (e.g., "help now," "critical," "severe pain," "emergency," "urgent," "SOS," "life-threatening," "immediate assistance").
- The described symptom itself is inherently high-risk or commonly associated with emergencies (e.g., "chest pain radiating to arm," "difficulty breathing," "uncontrolled bleeding," "loss of consciousness," "signs of stroke," "seizure").
- The user explicitly asks for "emergency information," "first aid for [symptom]," or "what to do in an emergency for [symptom]."
- The operational context (if available) suggests an ongoing acute or emergency situation.
Key Input Parameter Focus:
- symptom: The LLM must extract the specific medical symptom that is the focus of the emergency concern.
DDD Element Cross-Reference (Optional): See Entity: MedicalKnowledgeEntry (where urgency_level is 'emergency_critical'), Behaviour: WorkspaceEmergencyKnowledge.
Function: SymptomSearch
Primary Purpose: To retrieve general informational content about a medical symptom for understanding, learning, or non-urgent concerns.
Decision Criteria / Trigger Conditions:
- User's query is phrased as a request for general knowledge about a symptom (e.g., "what is [symptom]?," "tell me about [symptom]," "causes of [symptom]," "information on [symptom]").
- The query lacks any strong indicators of urgency or crisis as outlined for EmergencyKnowledge.
- The described symptom is presented as mild, for general awareness, or the user expresses a non-immediate need for information.
- The intent is clearly to learn or understand rather than to seek immediate, actionable guidance for a crisis.
Key Input Parameter Focus:
- symptom: The LLM must extract the specific medical symptom for which general information is being requested.
DDD Element Cross-Reference (Optional): See Entity: MedicalKnowledgeEntry (where urgency_level is 'general_informational'), Behaviour: WorkspaceGeneralSymptomInfo.

BOUNDED CONTEXT: General Keyword Search
Description: This Bounded Context handles all general information retrieval requests that are not specifically focused on medical symptoms requiring the specialized tools of the "Medical Symptom Inquiry" context. It governs the use of the SearchEngine tool for broad, keyword-based searches across a general corpus of information, similar to a standard web search engine.

Entities:
GenericInformationResource
Description: Represents any piece of information (e.g., webpage, article, document) retrievable by the SearchEngine tool using general keywords. This entity is distinct from MedicalKnowledgeEntry because it is not primarily classified by medical urgency or specific symptom focus.
Properties:
resource_id: string — Inferred unique identifier for the information resource.
title: string — Inferred title of the resource.
link: string — Inferred URL or reference to the resource.
summary_text: string — Inferred snippet or abstract of the resource content.
match_keyword: string — The primary keyword this resource was matched against.
Behaviours / API Call Signatures (Inferred):
Corresponds to Tool Function Name: SearchEngine
findGeneralInfoByKeyword(keyword: Keyword): GenericInformationResource[] — Retrieves a list of general information resources relevant to the provided keyword(s).
Preconditions: A keyword (Value Object) must be provided.
Postconditions: Returns a list of general search results.
Internal Data Resolution/Enrichment Steps (Examples):
- "The system uses a general-purpose search index and ranking algorithms to identify resources matching the keyword(s)."
Relationships:
None explicitly defined by the tools.
Belongs to Aggregate: GeneralInformationIndex

Value Objects:
Keyword
Description: Represents one or more terms forming a search query for general information. This is distinct from a Symptom Value Object, as a Keyword is used with the SearchEngine tool and typically does not imply a medical symptom query unless explicitly framed as such and still falling outside the medical context's specific criteria.
Properties:
text: string — The keyword or phrase to search for (e.g., "history of computing," "latest space discoveries," "best coffee shops in Paris").
Used by: SearchEngine (parameter keyword).

Aggregates:
GeneralInformationIndex
Root: GeneralInformationIndex (conceptual root, representing the entire corpus searchable by the engine)
Includes: GenericInformationResource (Entities)
Invariants:
- (Not directly enforced by this query-only tool.)
Key Operations / Multi-Step Interaction Patterns:
Corresponds to Tool Function Name: SearchEngine
- Operation: User query is for general information on a topic, not primarily a medical symptom.
- Internal Logic: LLM synthesizes Keyword from the query.
- Tool Call: SearchEngine is called with the Keyword.

Domain Events:
GeneralKeywordSearchInitiated
Triggered by: User query interpreted as a general information search, not fitting the criteria for medical symptom tools.
Payload:
keyword_text: string — The keyword(s) as provided by the user.
timestamp: datetime — Time of query.
Outcome / Impact: Leads to the selection and execution of the SearchEngine tool.
Potential Follow-up Actions / API Calls / Data Lookups:
- Call SearchEngine(keyword=keyword_text).

Tool Call Selection Logic for Bounded Context: General Keyword Search
Description: This Bounded Context is activated when a user's query is identified as a request for general information that does not primarily concern a specific medical symptom or does not require the specialized handling of the "Medical Symptom Inquiry" context.
Function: SearchEngine
Primary Purpose: To find and retrieve general information from a broad corpus based on user-provided keywords.
Decision Criteria / Trigger Conditions:
- The user's query is NOT primarily about obtaining information for a specific medical symptom (i.e., it does not fit the criteria for EmergencyKnowledge or SymptomSearch).
- The query consists of general terms, topics, questions, or phrases unrelated to personal medical conditions requiring urgent or general symptom explanation (e.g., "capital of France," "how to bake bread," "recent technology news," "define osmosis").
- Even if medical terms are used, the context is academic, research-oriented, or general knowledge rather than a personal health symptom inquiry (e.g., "history of virology," "pharmaceutical research companies").
- This tool is the default choice when the query cannot be confidently classified as a medical symptom inquiry requiring EmergencyKnowledge or SymptomSearch.
Key Input Parameter Focus:
- keyword: The LLM should extract the core subject, terms, or question from the user's query to be used as the search keyword. This can be a broader set of terms compared to the specific symptom parameter.
DDD Element Cross-Reference (Optional): See Entity: GenericInformationResource, Behaviour: findGeneralInfoByKeyword.

Notes:

The primary differentiation relies on the LLM's ability to accurately interpret user intent, specifically distinguishing between:
A request for medical information about a symptom versus a general keyword search.
If it's a symptom, discerning emergency/urgent needs versus general informational needs.
The urgency_level property of the MedicalKnowledgeEntry entity is an inferred characteristic of the underlying data that the tools EmergencyKnowledge and SymptomSearch are designed to target. The LLM's decision to call one tool over the other is effectively an attempt to target entries with the appropriate urgency_level.
This model assumes that the underlying knowledge bases for medical information are structured or tagged in a way that allows EmergencyKnowledge to access specifically emergency-related content and SymptomSearch to access more general content for the same symptom.
The definition of what constitutes an "emergency" symptom or "urgent" language will require careful tuning and potentially extensive examples for the tool-calling LLM.
